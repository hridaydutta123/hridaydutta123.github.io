                        <p>It presents an application that may run on Android-based mobile devices and could prepare localized crisis map through offline crowd-sourcing of situational information and a distributed processing of them. The situational information collected through the user interface of the proposed application is shared seamlessly among the mobile nodes during their opportunistic contacts through a custom-designed peer-to-peer file sharing application. The obtained crisis map is visualized on a nice map interface, on which information contents and mobility trails of other users along with userâ€™s own information contents are embedded. The mobility trails collectively may be used for travel route suggestion for the user during the changing environment after the crisis.</p>

                        <p>Sink based spanning tree topologies are effectively used in convergecast applications for efficient packet delivery with minimum forwarding delay, eliminating packet loss or duplicate packet delivery. For tree based convergecast, this paper theoretically shows that there is a trade-off between the topology architecture and the network traffic load. Depending on this trade-off, a hierarchical topology adaptation scheme is proposed for the tree based convergecast to improve overall application performances. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is analyzed using simulation results.</p>
