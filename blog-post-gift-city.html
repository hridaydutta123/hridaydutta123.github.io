                <p class="lead">An in-depth guide for international visitors to GIFT City, Gandhinagar, with practical tips on accommodation, transport, cuisine, cultural etiquette, and things to see and do.</p>
                <p><em>Posted on June 29, 2025 in <a href="#">travel</a></em></p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Who am I and why am I writing this?</h2>
                <p>I am <a href="https://hridaydutta123.github.io/">Hridoy</a>, currently working as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Cybersecurity at <a href="https://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/locations/campuses/gift-city-india">Deakin University, GIFT City, India</a>, since July 2024 after my postdoc from the <a href="http://cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge, UK</a>. <b>I have the distinction of being the first faculty member appointed at any international university campus in India!</b> This guide is intended to assist international visitors, whether you are here for business, research or leisure - navigate the chaos with a little less confusion and a lot more enjoyment.</p>

                <h2>About GIFT City: India's Futuristic Hub</h2>
                <p>GIFT (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) is more than just a business district; it's a vision of a future-ready India. Located in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat, it is being developed as a global hub for finance and technology. For a visitor, this means you'll be stepping into one of the most modern and well-planned areas in the country.</p>

                <p>Key features include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>State-of-the-Art Infrastructure:</strong> The city is built on a foundation of cutting-edge technology, including a district cooling system (a first in India), underground utility tunnels, and an automated waste collection system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Special Economic Zone (SEZ):</strong> This status provides various economic benefits, attracting top companies from around the world.</li>
                    <li><strong>A Green City:</strong> Despite its focus on technology and finance, GIFT City is designed with sustainability in mind, featuring green spaces and energy-efficient buildings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Arriving and Getting to GIFT City</h2>
                <p>Your port of entry will likely be the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Sardar%20Vallabhbhai%20Patel%20International%20Airport%20(AMD)"><strong>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport (AMD)</strong></a> in Ahmedabad, which is about a 30-45 minute drive from GIFT City.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Taxis and Ride-Sharing:</strong> The most convenient way to reach GIFT City is by booking a pre-paid taxi from the airport or using ride-sharing apps like <strong>Uber</strong> (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubercab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>) and <strong>Ola</strong> (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olacabs.customer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/ola-cabs-book-taxi-auto/id539179365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>), which are widely available.</li>
                    <li><strong>Car Rentals:</strong> If you learned to drive in a developed country, where people actually follow traffic rules - it is highly recommended you <strong>do not</strong> attempt this adventure. Your sanity (and the car) will thank you. If you still want to give it a try, here are some recommendations:
                    <ul>

                <h2>Accommodation: Where to Stay</h2>
                <h3>Short Stay</h3>
                <p>GIFT City and its vicinity offer a range of accommodation options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Luxury:</strong> For a premium experience, hotels like the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gift-city-club-gandhinagar"><strong>GIFT City Club (Radisson Hotels)</strong></a>, <a href="https://g.page/grand-mercure-gandhinagar?share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Grand Mercure Gandhinagar GIFT City</strong></a> and <a href="https://g.page/TheLeelaGandhinagar?share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>The Leela Gandhinagar</strong></a> offer excellent amenities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business & Mid-Range:</strong> Several business hotels offer great comfort and service. Some popular choices nearby include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fortune-Inn-Haveli-Gandhinagar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fortune Inn Haveli, Gandhinagar</strong></a>: A well-regarded option from the ITC group, a short drive away.</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Prominence Hotel-Gandhinagar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Prominence Hotel</strong></a>: Another comfortable mid-range option close to the city.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Service Apartments:</strong> If you are planning a longer stay, consider a service apartment, which provides a more home-like environment with kitchen facilities. <a href="https://blissapartments.in/"><strong>Bliss Serviced Apartments</strong></a> is one such option, though it may not be recommended for international visitors.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Long Stay</h3>
                <p>Planning to settle in for a while? GIFT City and surrounding areas like Gandhinagar, Randesan, Kudasan and Raysan offer numerous residential options suitable for professionals, families and even digital nomads with furniture preferences (Furnished/Unfurnished).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Online Listings:</strong> Only trust the trusted platforms: 
                        <a href="https://www.housing.com/in/rent/gandhinagar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Housing.com</strong></a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.magicbricks.com/property-for-rent/residential-real-estate?cityName=Gandhinagar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MagicBricks</strong></a> and 
                        <a href="https://www.99acres.com/property-in-gandhinagar-ffid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>99acres</strong></a>

                    <li><strong>Broker Wisdom:</strong> Want the place without the hunt? Trust brokers with solid ratings and reviews. Just remember, the going rate is usually one-month’s rent as brokerage. Yes, they will <i>"definitely show you the best flat just 2 minutes away"</i> - so keep your sneakers ready. Also, if you have spent some years abroad (and your accent picked up a bit of a global flair), it is highly advised to <i>switch to Indian accent protocol</i> to avoid the mysterious 'NRI/foreigner surcharge'. Apparently, clear enunciation signals sometimes mean you have deep pockets and possibly a suitcase full of dollars.</li>
                </ul>


                <h2>Navigating the Area</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Within GIFT City:</strong> The city is quite walkable, with lovely sidewalks and green areas perfect for a morning stroll - until the temperature hits 45°C and you feel like you are being slow-roasted. At that point, walking turns into a survival sport. As for driving, let us just say traffic rules here are more like polite suggestions and helmets seem to be optional fashion accessories. Your best bet? Take a cab, buckle up and enjoy the ride - it’s safer, and comes with free local driving entertainment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Travel:</strong> For traveling to Gandhinagar or Ahmedabad, <strong>Uber</strong> (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubercab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/uber-request-a-ride/id368677368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>) and <strong>Ola</strong> (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olacabs.customer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/ola-cabs-book-taxi-auto/id539179365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>) remain the most convenient options. Auto-rickshaws are also available but be prepared to negotiate the fare.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Connectivity and Communication</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SIM Cards:</strong> To stay connected, you can purchase a local SIM card at the airport or from official stores of providers like <a href="https://www.jio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jio</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.airtel.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Airtel</strong></a>, or <a href="https://www.myvi.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Vi (Vodafone Idea)</strong></a>.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Food Delivery Apps:</strong> Services like <strong>Swiggy</strong> (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.swiggy.android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/swiggy-food-grocery-delivery/id989540920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>) and <strong>Zomato</strong> (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.application.zomato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/zomato-food-delivery-dining/id434613896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>) operate efficiently in GIFT City and surrounding areas. 
                    You can order from a wide variety of restaurants offering local Gujarati cuisine, North and South Indian dishes, as well as popular international options.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Grocery Delivery:</strong> Apps like <strong>BigBasket</strong> (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigbasket.mobileapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/bigbasket-online-grocery-app/id660683603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>), <strong>Blinkit</strong> (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grofers.customerapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/blinkit-grocery-in-minutes/id966624624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>), and <strong>Zepto</strong> (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeptoconsumer.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/zepto-grocery-delivery/id1575225736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a>) offer quick and convenient delivery of groceries, fresh produce, and daily essentials. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>International Supermarkets:</strong> You will find well-stocked international groceries in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CnAbrpZf42zdNDvP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magson</a>. You can consider it to be mini-Aldi/Coles/Sainsbury/Walmart.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Local Supermarkets:</strong> You will find well-stocked grocery stores and mini-marts within or near GIFT City for essentials like snacks, toiletries and basic cooking ingredients. <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKp8DapDNjZwHYFj7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>D-Mart</strong></a> is nearby, just make sure to go during office hours (preferably before 5pm IST) or you might end up in a crowd that feels more like a last-minute airport check-in line before a long weekend (think elbows and carts with laser focus). But let's be honest, <i>why carry heavy grocery bags when you can just tap a screen?</i> It is way easier to use the above grocery apps.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Cuisine: A Taste of Gujarat</h2>
